## My name is Clarissa Fuller and this is a little showcase of some of my projects and skills! 

Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! I'm Clarissa, a recent graduate of Columbia University's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. My journey into the world of coding started with a strong curiosity and a passion for problem-solving.

During my time at Columbia, I've delved deep into the intricacies of web development, honing my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies. I'm a dedicated coder who thrives on creating elegant and user-friendly solutions to real-world problems. I believe that technology can make our lives better and more efficient, and I'm committed to being part of that positive change.

What sets me apart is my ability to blend creativity with precision. I enjoy the process of turning innovative ideas into functional, interactive web applications. From crafting responsive user interfaces to optimizing database performance, I take pride in every aspect of the development process.

This portfolio showcases some of the projects I've worked on during my bootcamp journey, reflecting my dedication to continuous learning, growth, and a passion for building meaningful digital experiences.

Feel free to explore my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or have a chat about all things tech. Let's bring your ideas to life through code!

## Usage/Tests

Navigating our interface is simple, in order to create a new routine, click the "create a new workout" button, or click the same link in the navigation bar.
Once on the Routine page, search for a workout, add your desired workout with your desired weight( in lbs), number of Sets, and number of Reps. When you click the "add to routine" button, your new routine will display on the left of the page, and allow you to edit the name of the Routine and the day of the week you would like to schedule it for.
The process should look something like this:
